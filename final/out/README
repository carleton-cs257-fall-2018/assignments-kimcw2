Moodle Jump

Edit:
We ran into many problems while implementing moodle jump. In the end we decided
to simplify our project and create a snake game instead. We still used MVC
to create this project, but now the objective of the game is to collect the red
squares, or apples, to increase your size. You lose when you hit your own tail
or the wall.

Moodle jump is like doodle jump but uses fun moodle references. There
is a 'Moodler' character that is jumping upwards on platforms. They are
increasing their score by getting higher. They use power-ups to get higher
but are challenged by monsters. The Moodler can shoot at the monsters to
clear the path. The goal is to get the highest score.

MVC is appropriate for this project because the software design method will
allow us to separate the model from the controller and view and make
updates to the model without affecting the other two. With this kind of
structure, we could also easily change Moodle Jump into a multigame platform.
Also, because there is a high interaction between the program and the user,
it makes sense to have a structure where input, processing, and output are
all distinct.
